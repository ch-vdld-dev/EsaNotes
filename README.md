# EsaNotes
Notes with Obsidian (Markdown language)
To share my notes with my students colleagues. And also have their notes

### Best Practice
Don't forget :
- to always pull before starting new notes.
- to always push after new/updates notes.
- maybe good idea to create a new personal notes beside mine and/or create a branch with your name 

### Usage:
To have a quick access to the content you want, you have a summary in [[3Ã¨me INFO]], from there you can go to any cursus and then to any notes
